Summary: If you use real robot, start [robot]_ros_bridge.launch. For simulation environment, start [robot].launch. This script usually contains test code with the sample client program.

[robot]_ros_bridge.launch : This file launches ros bridge software for specifi robot type. When you use real robot, launch this script after the robot started up (usually the script is named [robot]_startup.launch under the robot specific package), when you use the simulation, you do not have to call this sript, but use the [robot].launch file.

[robot].launch : This file start the simulated robot in OpenHRP3 and the ROS bridge software. This script contains test tag to start sammple (EusLisp) client program

[robot]_nosim.launch : This file is non dynamics version of [robot].launch

Following scripts are only for internal usage:

[robot]_startup.launch : This file start simulation robot in OpenHRP3 software.

[robot]_startup_nosim.launch : This file start simulated robot in OpenHRP3 software with out forward dynamics calculation.
