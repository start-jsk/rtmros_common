Abstract: This paper describes the second activity report of sub working group for the mobile robot in NEDO Intelligent
RT Software Project. The sub working group is organized by three research consortia who consist of National Institute of
Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, the Shibaura Institute of Technology consortium (Chiba Institute of
Technology, NEC Soft, PUES), and the Segway Japan consortium (Tohoku University, International Rescue System Institute,
Kyoto University). The joint interface of RT component for mobile robots is proposed by the three research consortia as
activity efforts
